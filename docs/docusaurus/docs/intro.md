# Radio-Spectrum SHARC

## Introduction to SHARC

Welcome to **SHARC**, a powerful simulator designed to support **SHARing and Compatibility** studies of radiocommunication systems, focusing on **modeling and simulating IMT networks and systems** for use in sharing and compatibility studies.

### Purpose of SHARC

SHARC helps users simulate and evaluate various radiocommunication systems to understand how they share and coexist in the radio spectrum. Whether you're assessing interference, spectrum allocation, or compatibility across different communication technologies, SHARC provides the tools you need to ensure the optimal use of radio frequencies.

## üìö Key Features of SHARC

- **Compatibility Studies**: Simulate interactions between different systems like IMT (International Mobile Telecommunications), satellite services, and terrestrial systems.
- **Flexible and Scalable**: SHARC supports simulation of both **satellite** and **terrestrial** communication systems, offering both large-scale global studies and localized scenarios.
- **Modular Architecture**: The software is designed to be easily extensible, allowing users to add their own models, systems, and study areas.
- **Integration with ITU Framework**: SHARC operates according to the international guidelines set by the ITU-R recommendations, ensuring that simulations align with industry standards.
