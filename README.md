# SHARC
Welcome to SHARC, a simulator for use in SHARing and Compatibility studies of radiocommunication systems. The development of this software is being lead by the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA) of Brazil, ANATEL, and it implements the framework proposed by Recommendation ITU-R M.2101 for "modelling and simulation of IMT networks and systems for use in sharing and compatibility studies".

In order to contribute actively with ITU-R studies, the Spectrum, Orbit and Broadcasting Division of the Brazilian National Telecommunication Agency (ANATEL) has been leading a collaborative project for the development of an open-source simulation tool called SHARC (simulator for SHARing and Compatibility studies). This is a free software that complies with the framework proposed by Recommendation ITU-R M.2101 for modelling and simulation of IMT systems.

The focus of this simulator is the modeling of IMT systems, taking into account several characteristics of these systems such as: heterogeneous networks, antenna beamforming, distribution of base stations and user equipments, power control, resource-blocks allocation, and other parameters.

This simulation tool can be used to support sharing and compatibility studies between IMT and other radiocommunication services or systems, like fixed-satellite service (FSS), high-altitude platform system (HAPS), fixed point-to-point links, among others.
