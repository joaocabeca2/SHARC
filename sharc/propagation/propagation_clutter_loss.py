        This Recommendation (ITU_R_P_2108-1/2021) provides methods for
        estimating loss through clutter at frequencies between 30 MHz and 100 GHz.

        The ITU Radiocommunication Assembly,
        considering
             a) that, for system planning and interference assessment it may be
             necessary to account for the attenuation suffered by radio waves in
             passing over or between buildings;
             b) that, where a terrestrial station may be shielded by buildings a
             detailed calculation for a general case can be difficult to formulate
             and losses due to clutter must be considered dependant on the
             deployment scenario;
             c) that, where terrestrial stations are in motion the clutter envir-
             onment of the radio path will be variable,
        recognizing
             a) that Recommendation ITU-R P.1411 contains data and models for
             short-range radio system, mainly within an urban environment from
             300 MHz to 100 GHz;
             b) that Recommendation ITU-R P.2040 contains basic expressions for
             reflection from and penetration through building materials, and a
             harmonised representation of building material electrical properties
             above about 100 MHz;
             c) that Recommendation ITU-R P.452 contains a prediction method for
             the evaluation of interference between stations on the surface of
             the Earth at frequencies from about 0.1 GHz to 50 GHz, accounting
             for both clear-air and hydrometeor scattering interference mechanisms;
             d) that Recommendation ITU-R P.1812 describes a propagation predict-
             ion method suitable for terrestrial point-to-area services in the
             frequency range 30 MHz to 6 000 MHz;
             e) that Recommendation ITU-R P.833 presents several models to enable
             the user to evaluate the effect of vegetation on radiowave signals
             between 30 MHz and 60 GHz;
             f) that Recommendation ITU-R P.2109 provides a statistical model
             for building entry loss for frequencies between about 80 MHz and 100 GHz,
        recommends
             that the material in Recomendation ITU-R P.2108-1/2021 be used to
             estimate clutter loss.

        This method gives a statistical distribution of clutter loss. The model
        can be applied for urban and suburban clutter loss modelling. An

        clutter type, location within the clutter and movement in the clutter.
