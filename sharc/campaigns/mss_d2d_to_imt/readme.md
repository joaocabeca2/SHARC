# Introduction

This campaign simulates a MSS-DC constellation and computes the interference of it into a IMT station positioned
on Earth surface.
The MSS-DC orbit elements are given as parameteres as well as the IMT coordinates.

The selection of interferer satellites is done as follows:
- At each drop a random intant of the satellites is generated
- Those satellies that are visible from the IMT terrestrial station are set as "active".
- The visibily constraint is set as the satellites with elevation angles equal or greater that 5 deg (from the IMT
station horizon)

# Running the simulation

Inside the `./scripts` folder there are two scritps for executing the simulation:

### MSS-DC System A campaign
`start_simulation_system_A.py` runs the scenario where the UE station is fixed in Bras√≠lia.

### MSS-DC Varying UE latitude
`start_simulations_lat_variation.py` runs a batch of simulations where the UE longitude is varied over the 0 deg meridian. This is to access the impact of longitude values into the total interference.

Before running the `start_simulations_lat_variation.py` campaing the parameters for the simulation must be generated by runing the `parameter_gen.py` script.

# Plotting the results
Run `plot_resutls.py`for the "simulation system A" campaign and `plot_resutls_lat_variation.py` for the "Varying UE latitude" campaign.
